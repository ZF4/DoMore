# Stride 🚀🏃‍♂️📵

Stride is a mindful productivity app designed to help you reclaim your time and energy. By turning screen time into movement time, Stride lets you **block distracting apps** and **unlock them** only after you've achieved **fitness goals you set for yourself**.

---

## Key Features

- **App Blocking:** Choose the apps that distract you most and block them within Stride.
- **Fitness Unlock Goals:** Set personal fitness milestones (like steps, minutes exercised, or distance) to regain access.
- **Health & Screen Time Integration:** Stride uses HealthKit and Screen Time APIs to track progress and encourage healthier habits.
- **Built for You:** Empowering and customizable — set your own rules and goals to stay focused and active.

---

## How It Works

1. **Select Apps to Block** – Choose which apps you want to restrict access to.
2. **Set Your Goals** – Define the physical activity required to unlock those apps.
3. **Move to Unlock** – Once you hit your goal, the apps become available again.
4. **Track & Celebrate** – Visualize your progress and celebrate your wins.
